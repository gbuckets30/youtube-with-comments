# Youtube With Comments

If you are one of those people who like to scroll through comments while watching a video, you know how irritating it is to use YouTube on a pc.
When we scroll down to the comments, the video gets hidden. This is a very unpleasant experience as compared to the mobile app. 

**YouTube With Comments allows you to continue using the web app, while also providing the benefits of the mobile app, by just entering the video ID in the search bar**

_I will update this space with further details as the project moves forward_
